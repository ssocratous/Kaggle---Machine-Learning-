Iowa house data analysis using decision trees to predict house prices

You ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past. and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.

Machine learning works the same way. We'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.

This Machine Learning project involves loading and analysing Iowa house price data with the view of predicting house prices going forward.
We begin by using a simple Decision Tree model to predict these house prices and then we compare the accuracy(Mean absolute error) of this model to a RandomForestRegressor model. 

We also look at how the initial data set and features(variables used in the model) can be cleaned and filled(imputed) to unsure the model returns realistic predictions.
